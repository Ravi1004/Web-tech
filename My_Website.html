            Hello everyone, I am Ravi Viswanadhula. I would like to share my experience sofar in MSIT. Will start with why MSIT is diffrent
            from any other courses available. The main characteristic of MSIT is "learning by doing" this is the type of mode that will not give the
            livarage of procrastinating things that student needs to do. In my bachlour's, I alwasy used to procrastinate things, whether it maybe
            implementing what i have learned or to start learning a new course. I felt that I am being forced to complete the work in
            Initial days of MSIT but it took no time for me to realize that its necessary to keep students focused on work. Now I am comfortable
            with the type of learning here.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, now we will look into courses and perks of joining this course. Will start with the courses that I completed so far and then
            the perks.
